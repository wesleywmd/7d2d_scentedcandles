# Scented Candles - AOE Effects

The original idea for this mod was to create an object placable in a base to provide an AOE effect. After some work and putting together what is available, I was able to create this mod. I will admit its not perfect but its functional.

You are able to craft a special scented candle in 1 of 5 scents. Each scent has its own specific AOE effect. Each candle operated like a campfire and only emits AOE when it is fueled and turned on. 

1. Blueberry Aloe - health regen aoe
2. Chrysanthemum - efficient digestion aoe (same as Red Tea)
3. Coffee - stamina regen aoe
4. Pumpkin - increased damage
5. Death - surprise, it smells like zombies
